==============================    
Welcomer to the WooSah Codex!       
==============================  

What is the WooSah Codex?  Glad you asked! The Codex is a thing that consists of two parts:
  * A dynamic collection of WooSah properties (e.g. Model, Material) and property types (e.g. Cosmo, Copper)    
  * The rules (e.g. “Copper cannot be anodized”) about how those properties can be combined to make the WooSahs that we all love to spin  

What the Codex is not --  
  * A list.  Although it can be used to create a list.   
  * An inventory.  Although it can be used to create an inventory.
  * A database.  Although it can be used to create a database.  
  * A web page.  Although.. you get it!
